# Space Letters
Game in python using PyGame, inspired in Space Invader but with educational purpose.

In this game there is a databse with words and tips. This is stored in the db.txt file. The game will than work getting a random entry from the list and displaying in the screen. Use can use arrow-left and arrow-right to move the ship, and use space to shoot. 

Game rules:
----------------
1. User must shoot the correct letters to win the game. 
2. User must also shoot the other letters to prevent them from colliding with the ship.

* Texts in the game are in Dutch as this was designed to help my kid to learn the Ductch Language.
